### 2.usage:
This subsystem  is used to detect whether a wall is close or far from a car while parkin so I created a tinkercad sketch that uses ultra sonic sensor to detect the measured distance and display it on serial monitor and also make an indicator contains a 3 led and a buzzer and each of the 3 led and buzzer will behave different depend on the state
1. first state: the wall is between 250 cm and 150 cm
the first led will be high buzzer will start make sound and stop in a fixed frequency
2. second state: the wall is in between 150cm and 100 cm
the first two led will be high and the buzzer frequency will be faster
3. third state: the wall is closer than 100 cm
all the led will be high and the buzzer frequency will be maximum

### 2.usage:
It is a simple system using 7 segment display and IR remote so that when:  
1. A number is clicked on the remote the number will be displayed to the 7 segment
2. VOL+ button is clicked the number will be increased by one
3. VOL- is clicked the number will be decreased by one
4. up button is clicked the display will increase the number by one each second until it reaches 9
5. down button is clicked the display will decrease the number by one each second until it reaches 0
